##  Project Outline
AI Spy: Using AI can determine your images.

When I was a child, I really loved the Where's Waldo and I Spy Books. You are given an image and a list of things to find and you tried to determine if you could find those images as quickly as possible. With AI Spy, give us a picture and the model will determine what you have in the image. We are looking for unique images that you will give great answers. We will save the AI answers in a Firebase backend. 

##### Everything we need to turn in with our capstone project:

1. The live URL to your project
1. The link to your GitHub page with the code for the project
1. Your resume (if you're looking for a job)
1. A short video on YouTube (2-3 minutes) recording your screen with your voice describing the project telling: why you decided on this project and what were some of the technical aspects/challenges of your process to build the project.
