##  Project Outline
AI Spy: Using AI can determine your images.

When I was a child, I really loved the Where's Waldo and I Spy Books. We were given an image and a list of things to find. The goal was for us to find those images as quickly as possible. This is my second U of A Global Campus Course. I wanted to combine elements of what I learned in the Data Science Certificate with the Front End Development Course. AI Spy was born. We provide the images and see if AI Spy can determine the image that we provided. We are looking for unique images that will give the best answers. We will save the AI answers in a Firebase backend and share the feedback that was provided. 

##### Everything we need to turn in with our capstone project:

1. The live URL to your project
1. The link to your GitHub page with the code for the project
1. Your resume (if you're looking for a job)
1. A short video on YouTube (2-3 minutes) recording your screen with your voice describing the project telling: why you decided on this project and what were some of the technical aspects/challenges of your process to build the project.
